# AxesHelper.

An axis object to visualize the 1, 2 or 3 axes.

I use AxesHelper in my [three.js](https://threejs.org/) projects for displaying of the axes in canvas.
[Example](https://raw.githack.com/anhr/AxesHelper/master/).

Uses in my projects:
 * [AxesHelper](https://github.com/anhr/AxesHelper)
 * [myThreejs](https://github.com/anhr/myThreejs)

## Quick start

* Create a folder on your localhost named as [folderName].
* Download [three.js](https://github.com/anhr/three.js) repository into your "[folderName]\three.js\dev" folder.
* Download [commonNodeJS](https://github.com/anhr/commonNodeJS) repository into your "[folderName]\commonNodeJS\master" folder.
* Download [cookieNodeJS](https://github.com/anhr/cookieNodeJS) repository into your "[folderName]\cookieNodeJS\master" folder.
* Download [dat.gui](https://github.com/anhr/dat.gui) repository into your "[folderName]\dat.gui\CustomController" folder.
* Download [SpriteText](https://github.com/anhr/SpriteText) repository into your "[folderName]\SpriteText\master" folder.
* Open http://localhost/[folderName]/AxesHelper/master/index.html for testing of your downloads.

The easiest way to use AxesHelper in your code is import AxesHelper from AxesHelper.js file in your JavaScript module. [Example](https://raw.githack.com/anhr/AxesHelper/master/)
```
import { AxesHelper } from './AxesHelper.js';
```
or
```
import { AxesHelper } from 'https://raw.githack.com/anhr/AxesHelper/master/AxesHelper.js';
```

Now you can use AxesHelper in your javascript code. See [AxesHelper API](https://raw.githack.com/anhr/AxesHelper/master/jsdoc/index.html) for details.
