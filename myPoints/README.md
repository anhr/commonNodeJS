# MyPoints
I use <b>MyPoints</b> in my [three.js](https://threejs.org/) projects for create [THREE.Points](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=Poi#api/en/objects/Points).
[Example](https://raw.githack.com/anhr/commonNodeJS/master/myPoints/Examples/index.html).

Uses in my projects:
 * [myThree](../myThree)
 * [AxesHelper](../AxesHelper)
 * [FrustumPoints](../frustumPoints)
 * [Player](../player)
 
See [MyPoints API](https://raw.githack.com/anhr/commonNodeJS/master/myPoints/jsdoc/index.html) for details.
