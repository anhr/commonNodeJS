# CanvasMenu.

My [dropdown menu](https://github.com/anhr/commonNodeJS/tree/master/DropdownMenu) for canvas in my [three.js](https://threejs.org/) projects.

or download [three.js](https://github.com/anhr/three.js) repository into your "[folderName]\three.js\dev" folder.
```
import * as THREE from './three.js/dev/build/three.module.js';
```
